# Analysis of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Insight Into The Factors that Affect it

This repository contains an R Markdown file (`Case Study Project.Rmd`) that analyzes the factors affecting systolic blood pressure (SBP) using a dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, model validation, and model diagnostics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is called "BloodPressure.xlsx". It contains information about various factors such as age, gender, BMI, stress level, salt intake, smoking status, alcohol use, race, and treatment for hypertension, along with the corresponding SBP values.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Introduction**: Describes the research question, background, and the variables considered in the analysis.
2. **Data Description**: Provides descriptive statistics for each variable and explores the relationships between the response variable (SBP) and the exploratory variables.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Checks for missing data, duplicate data, and data integrity. Performs necessary data transformations and removes unnecessary columns.
4. **Model Building and Validation**: Builds multiple regression models, performs model selection, and validates the final selected model.
5. **Model Diagnostics**: Checks if the regression assumptions are valid using residual diagnostics and identifies any outlying or influential observations.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizes the findings, addresses limitations of the study, and provides references.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you need to have R and the required packages installed. The necessary packages are listed at the beginning of the R Markdown file. You can open the `Case Study Project.Rmd` file in RStudio or any compatible R Markdown editor and knit the document to generate the analysis report. Make sure to have the "BloodPressure.xlsx" dataset file in the same directory as the R Markdown file.
